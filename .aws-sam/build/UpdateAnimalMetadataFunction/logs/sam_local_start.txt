You can now browse to the above endpoints to invoke your functions. You do not need to restart/reload SAM CLI while working on your functions, changes will 
be reflected instantly/automatically. If you used sam build before running local commands, you will need to re-run sam build for the changes to be picked   
up. You only need to restart SAM CLI if you update your AWS SAM template
